## Informed Consent for Participation in Research

Study ID# STUDY00002465\
Version 06/11/2025

Dear participant,

We are inviting you to take part in a research study conducted by researchers at UMass Chan Medical School. The purpose of this study is to understand how people behave and interact in situations that simulate the spread of infectious diseases, using this app created with the  Epidemica technology developed by the Colubri Lab.

The study is expected to last for two days, and your participation is completely voluntary. You are free to decline or stop at any time by selecting the "Leave Study" option in the app, which will also delete your data from our system.

**If you agree to participate:**
- You will take part in a simulated outbreak game that will run for two days.
- The app will show you a simulated health status in its main screen. This status may change depending on the spread of the virtual pathogen during the game. 
- You may be asked to respond to brief multiple-choice surveys during the game.
- You will interact with other participants through anonymous Bluetooth proximity signals.
- Your phone may collect environmental data (e.g., temperature) using built-in sensors.

No identifiable information (like your name, email, or GPS location) will be collected. Instead, your app will be assigned a random code (UUID) that cannot be traced back to you. Your responses and interaction data will be stored securely and used only for research purposes.
We will try to limit access to your information to only authorized members of the research team. However, complete privacy cannot be guaranteed. The UMass Chan Medical School, including the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and compliance offices, may access your data if needed.

**Compensation:**
This study does not offer any compensation for participation. 

If you have any questions about this study, you can contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Andres Colubri, at [Andres.Colubri@umassmed.edu](mailto:Andres.Colubri@umassmed.edu).

Thank you for considering participation in this study.
