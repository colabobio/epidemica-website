## Informed Consent for Participation in Research

**Study ID# STUDY00002465**\
**Version 11/13/2025**

Dear participant,

We are inviting you to take part in a research study conducted by researchers at UMass Chan Medical School. The purpose of this study is to understand how people behave and interact in situations that simulate the spread of infectious diseases, using this app created with the Epidemica technology developed by the Colubri Lab (https://co-labo.org/).

The study is expected to last for two weeks, and your participation is completely voluntary. You are free to decline or stop at any time by selecting the "Leave Study" or "Leave Game" option in the app, which will also delete your data from our system.

**If you agree to participate:**
- You will take part in a simulated outbreak game that will run for two weeks.
- The app will show you a simulated health status in its main screen. This status may change depending on the spread of the virtual pathogen during the game. 
- You will be asked to respond to anonymous surveys about attitudes regarding infectious diseases and interventions to mitigate disease spread both in real life and during the game.
- You will be asked to make a daily choice through the app to virtually quarantine or not. This choice will not have any effect on your daily activities. It will only set an internal state in the app that will influence spread of the virtual pathogen.
- You will interact with other participants through anonymous Bluetooth proximity signals.

No identifiable information (like your name, email, or GPS location) will be collected. Instead, your app will be assigned a random code (UUID) that cannot be traced back to you. Your responses and interaction data will be stored securely and used only for research purposes.
We will try to limit access to your information to only authorized members of the research team. However, complete privacy cannot be guaranteed. The UMass Chan Medical School, including the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and compliance offices, may access your data if needed.

**Compensation:**
This study offers compensation for participation:
- Every day, a number of participants will be randomly selected to receive a voucher for discounts at local business. The app will send a notification with the IDs of the selected users.
- At the end of the study, all participants will be automatically included in point-based lottery for gift cards. Each participant will be assigned a number of lottery cards proportional to the final point score.

If you have any questions about this study, you can contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Andres Colubri, at Andres.Colubri@umassmed.edu.

Thank you for considering participation in this study.
