# About Epidemica

## Our Mission

Epidemica is a pioneering research platform developed by the [Colubri Lab](https://co-labo.org/) at UMass Chan Medical School. Our mission is to advance the understanding of infectious disease dynamics through innovative digital experimentation and behavioral analysis.

## The Technology

### Digital Disease Simulation
Our platform creates realistic simulations of infectious disease spread using mobile applications that participants can download and use. These simulations allow researchers to study transmission patterns, behavioral responses, and intervention effectiveness in controlled environments.

### Bluetooth Proximity Sensing
Epidemica uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to detect when participants are in close proximity to each other. This anonymous sensing creates a network of potential transmission pathways that mirror real-world contact patterns.

### Behavioral Data Collection
Beyond tracking proximity, our platform captures:
- **Decision-making patterns** during simulated outbreaks
- **Risk perception** and attitude changes
- **Protective behavior adoption** (e.g., virtual mask-wearing, social distancing)
- **Response to public health messaging**

## Research Impact

### Published Studies
Our research using the Epidemica platform has contributed to several peer-reviewed publications in the fields of:
- Computational epidemiology
- Digital health interventions
- Behavioral science
- Public health policy

### Ongoing Research
Current research projects using Epidemica include:
- **Contact Tracing Effectiveness**: Studying how different contact tracing strategies perform under various conditions
- **Vaccine Hesitancy**: Understanding factors that influence vaccination decisions during outbreaks
- **Social Network Effects**: Analyzing how social connections affect disease transmission and prevention behaviors
- **Intervention Timing**: Evaluating the optimal timing for public health interventions

## Privacy and Ethics

### Anonymous by Design
Epidemica is built with privacy as a core principle:
- **No personal information** is collected or stored
- **Random UUIDs** are used instead of identifiable data
- **Secure data transmission** and storage protocols
- **IRB-approved** research protocols

### Ethical Research Standards
All research conducted using Epidemica follows strict ethical guidelines:
- Informed consent from all participants
- Voluntary participation with the right to withdraw at any time
- Transparent data use policies
- Regular ethical review and oversight

## The Team

### Principal Investigator
**Dr. Andr√©s Colubri** is an Assistant Professor at UMass Chan Medical School and the director of the Colubri Lab. His research focuses on computational approaches to infectious disease modeling and digital health interventions.

### Research Areas
The Colubri Lab specializes in:
- Computational epidemiology
